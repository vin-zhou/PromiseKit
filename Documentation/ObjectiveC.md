# Objective-C

PromiseKit has two promise classes:

* `Promise<T>` (Swift)
* `AnyPromise` (Objective-C)

Each is designed to be an approproate promise implementation for the strong
points of its language:

* `Promise<T>` is strict, defined and precise.
* `AnyPromise` is loose and dynamic.

Unlike most libraries we have extensive bridging support, you can use PromiseKit
in mixed projects with mixed language targets and mixed language libraries.
